    Everyone of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because it is my passion. I find joy in it. My greatest inspiration is nature that inspires me to make lovely and colourful drawings. It is my belief that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist. You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing. When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colours with me. My colours are my best friend. I like drawing since I was 4 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of beautiful things to show it on a piece of paper such as tree, house, waterfall, hilly areas, little girl walking through the meadows. I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their anniversaries because they are very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing. The most attractive and unique part of my drawing is the concept of facial expressions of human beings. My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush. The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint.  I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps and is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby. In a nutshell, I seek peace and pleasure in drawing.
